To build run `npx webpack --config webpack.config.js`
To start the visualisation run **dist/index.html**.

Use the menu at the top left-hand corner to vary amperage and permeability.
There are different circuits that can be chosen by changing the circuit_name in the **config.js**.
Also do not forget about "balanced values" for every circuit for better visualisation.

Do not forget to see **Magnetostatic-field-visualisation.ipynb** for a theoretical explanation.

Enjoy!
