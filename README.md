To start the visualisation run **index.html**.

Use the menu at the top left-hand corner to vary amperage and permeability.
There are different circuits that can be chosen by changing the circuit_name in the **Config.js**.
Also do not forget about "balanced values" for every circuit for better visualisation. 

Enjoy!
